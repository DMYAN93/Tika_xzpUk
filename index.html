The series is known for its intricate narratives, morally ambiguous choices, and attention to detail in creating rich and immersive worlds for players to explore.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The games are represented in a third-person view perspective in a partially open world environment. During the game, the player is faced with difficult decisions that affect the ending of the story and the game world. The choices players make in The Witcher games can have immediate and long-term consequences, affecting relationships between characters, opening up new quests and storylines.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The quests have multiple solutions and branching paths, depending on the player's choices, adding to the game's replayability and encouraging exploration.

			<h2>Main series</h2>

			<h3>The Witcher</h3>
			<p>In 1996 and 1997, a Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin) video game was being developed by Metropolis Software in Poland, but it was canceled. The game's director was Adrian Chmielarz, former People Can Fly co-owner and creative director, who coined the translation "The Witcher" during its development. According to Chmielarz, the game would have been a 3D action-adventure game with role-playing elements such as moral choices and experience points.[4]</p>
			<br>
			<p>n 2003, Polish video-game developer CD Projekt Red negotiated with Sapkowski for rights to The Witcher, given the languishing work at Metropolis,[5] and released The Witcher, a role-playing game based on the saga in October 2007 for personal computers. It was well-publicized and, although it was the developer's first game, it received critical praise in Europe and North America. The Witcher was published in Poland by CD Projekt and worldwide by Atari. A console version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf with the same story and a different engine and combat system, was scheduled for release in fall 2009 but was canceled that spring. The game's story takes place around five years after the events of the main book saga.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>The Witcher 2:Assassins of Kings</h3>
			<p>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings (Polish: Wiedźmin 2: Zabójcy królów) is the sequel to The Witcher, developed by CD Projekt Red. On 16 September 2009, before Assassins of Kings was introduced, a video of the game was leaked;[6] two days later, CD Projekt Red confirmed that it was in development.[7] Assassins of Kings was published in Poland by CD Projekt, by Namco Bandai Games in Europe and by Atari in North America. The game was also distributed digitally through Steam and DRM-free on Good Old Games. It takes place around half a year after the events of the first game.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>
			<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (Polish: Wiedźmin 3: Dziki Gon) was released on 19 May 2015 and quickly came to be considered one of the greatest video games of all time, shipping over ten million copies by March 2016.[8] Subsequently two expansion packs were released, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Hearts of Stone (Polish: Wiedźmin 3: Dziki Gon – Serca z kamienia) in 2015 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (Polish: Wiedźmin 3: Dziki Gon – Krew i wino) in 2016. The game was updated in December 2022 with a variety of visual enhancements and gameplay tweaks.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>The Witcher Remake</h3>
			<p>A remake of The Witcher (2007) which was formerly first teased under the codename, Canis Majoris. The original game will be rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 by Fool's Theory with full creative supervision from The Witcher series staff and CD Projekt Red.[3]</p>

			<h3>Project Polaris</h3>
			<p>Polaris is a codename for the next installment in The Witcher series. It will use Unreal Engine 5 instead of REDengine, which the two previous games used.[1] The game is to be the beginning of a new saga. CDPR aim to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG trilogy.</p>
